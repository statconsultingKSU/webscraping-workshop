# Web scraping in R or Python
A workshop presented as part of Kent State University Libraries 2023 Digital Scholarship Series Showcase.

**About:**
In this session, weâ€™ll give an overview of how web scraping works, talk about how to assess whether web scraping is right for your project (including ethical and copyright issues), and show a worked example of a few web scraping tasks that are possible using the R packages rvest and xml2 (and other scraping tools, such as Python). Prior familiarity with R or Python is helpful, but not required.
